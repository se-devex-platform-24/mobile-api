# Security Audit Process

## Introduction
Regular security audits are essential to ensure the protection of user data and compliance with data protection regulations. This document outlines the process for conducting security audits within our system.

## Objectives
- Identify potential vulnerabilities in the system.
- Ensure compliance with relevant data protection regulations.
- Enhance the security of user data both in transit and at rest.

## Audit Frequency
Security audits should be conducted quarterly, with additional audits scheduled as needed based on system changes or emerging threats.

## Audit Process
1. **Preparation**
